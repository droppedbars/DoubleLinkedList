DroppedBarsDataStructures
=========================

Project of datastructures

This is a project of data structures that I have built either out of necessity, or interest.
Unit testing is done with PHPUnit 3.7.37 (http://phpunit.de/index.html) as that version is compatible with PHPStorm 7.1, on which these projects are built.
